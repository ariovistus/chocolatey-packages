    NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
    efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
    records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
    arrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
    introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to
    create arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable for
    interfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.

    There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,
    basic linear algebra and random number generation.
